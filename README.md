NOTE: This theme will made to only work on [This page](https://wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw) as other pages may break with this CSS. I will eventually work on a single CSS that retextures everything without breaking anything

# To use this theme

- Click the `Stylus` icon
- Then click `Manage`
- Then click `Write new style`
- Give it a name
- Click the `Import` Button
- Copy and paste in the following into the window that popped up

```
@-moz-document url-prefix("https://wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw") {
@import url("https://css.advexed.co.uk/Stylus/Wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw/Core.css");
}
```

- Click `Overwrite style`

Thats it you should have the theme now

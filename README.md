NOTE: This theme will made to only work on [this page](https://wiimmfi.de/stats/mkw) as other pages may break with this CSS. I will eventually work on a single CSS document that retextures everything without breaking anything.

NOTE 2: [Join my discord server](https://discord.gg/axEsMhZwyZ) for help with anything that isnt working or any fixes that have been missed.

NOTE 3: This theme is a dark mode theme.
